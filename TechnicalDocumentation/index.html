        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).</p>
        <p>"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.</p>
        <p>An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by "<" and ">". The name of an element inside a tag is case-insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the <code>title</code> tag can be written as <code>Title</code>, <code>TITLE</code>, or in any other way. However, the convention and recommended practice is to write tags in lowercase.</p>

        <p class="subtitle">CORS enabled image</p>
        <p>The crossorigin attribute, in combination with an appropriate CORS header, allows images defined by the <code>img</code> element to be loaded from foreign origins and used in a <code>canvas</code> element as if they were being loaded from the current origin.</p>
        <p class="subtitle">CORS setting attributes</p>
        <p>Some HTML elements that provide support for CORS, such as <code>img</code> or <code>video</code>, have a crossorigin attribute (crossOrigin property), which lets you configure the CORS requests for the element's fetched data.</p>

            <p>HTML consists of elements, each of which may be modified by some number of attributes. HTML documents are connected to each other with links.</p>

            <p>Elements in HTML have attributes. These are additional values that configure the elements or adjust their behavior in various ways.</p>

            <p class="subtitle">Global attribute</p>
            <p>Global attributes may be specified on all HTML elements, even those not specified in the standard. This means that any non-standard elements must still permit these attributes, even though those elements make the document HTML5-noncompliant.</p>

            <p class="subtitle">Inline level elements</p>
            <p>HTML elements are usually "inline-level" or "block-level" elements. An inline-level element occupies only the space bounded by the tags that define it. A block-level element occupies the entire space of its parent element (container), thereby creating a "block box".</p>
